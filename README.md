# the painted mandala

pretty unfamiliar with github pages so this is a test run to see how this might be useful.

### test run to see how pictures are displayed.

         im an artist who really loves geometry, islamic art, and painting, all key components in my art.


#### **_this is definitely interesting and ill probably venture more into how to configure more of the settings (importing pictures, changing fonts, etc)._**
